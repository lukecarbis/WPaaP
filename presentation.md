# What is
# WordPress as a Product?

???

* Broadly, when your product is centrally hosted, and people pay to use your website / service

* Examples:
	* ManageWP
	* InfinteWP
	* iThemes Sync
	* Happy Tables
	* Restaurant Engine
	* Hello Bar
	* PressBooks
	* Rainmaker Platform
	* WordPress.com
	
> Still a lot of untapped potential.

* More than just a blogging platform
	* Blogging
	* CMS
	* Apps

* Lots of built-in foundational groundwork for products
	* User Management
	* Custom Post Types / Taxonomies

* Lots of tools and plugins to make it even easier
	* Subscription
	* WooCommerce / EDD
	* Restrict Content Pro
	
* Makes sites more replicable and automated
	* Agencies can productise their services
	* Use of WP CLI to automate WordPress installs / setups

But this presentation isn't about the technical details.

There are already presentations on WordPress.tv about _why_ WP is a good platform for your product.

Since WordPress makes such a good platform for products, there are lots of opportunities for products in your business.

I'd like to talk about how to make your WPaaP successful.

# Experimentation
## Hypothesis Driven Development

???

Experimentation in Product Development is a half-science, there's still a lot of ideation generation.

> Hypothesis Driven Development

It's the best approach for developing product ideas. Here's how it works…

---

name: idea
class: center, middle

.jumboji[💡]
## 1. Have an idea

???

You have an idea for a product.

What next? 

* Get your friends opinions?
* Go ask your Mum what she thinks?
* Take a weekend to put it together and RELEASE it

#### If our aim here is to launch a great product, with a market fit, as quickly as possible, then doing these things would be like trying to shoot a _moving target_, _at a distance_, _in the dark_.

No. Keep your weekend. Instead…

---

name: hypothesis
class: center, middle

.jumboji[🤔]
## 2. Create a hypothesis

???

Create a hypothesis

A hypothesis doesn't start with "I believe..." (otherwise it's true by default)

Be more clear:
>"If this, then that"

A good start:
>"If I show people a screenshot, they will download"

Be even clearer:
>"If I show people who work for a WordPress Agency a screenshot demonstrating how my product will save them time, they will download it"

---

name: test
class: center, middle

.jumboji[✅]
## 3. Test the hypothesis

???

Test the hypothesis.

Gut decisions are the enemy. Set up a mental alert for any time you come across one.

You need DATA. You need cold, hard FACTS.

This allows you to:

* Make the correct decision faster
* Justify your decision (i.e. to stakeholders)

#### When we use hypotheses to inform our product approach, we _know the exact position_ of our product target.

---

name: validation
class: center, middle, inverse

# Validation
## Minimum Viable Experiment

???

Let's talk about that last step - testing your hypothesis.

Typically this is done with an MVP: Minimum Viable Product

* MVP? A good approach, but I prefer MVE - Minimum Viable Experiment
* Different people have different ideas about what a product is
* By calling it an experiment, it takes away a lot of stakeholder attachment
* The idea of an MVE is to test a hypothesis

---

name: knowledge
class: center, middle, inverse

.jumboji[☝️]
## Produce Knowledge, Quickly

???

The idea of an MVP comes from the Lean Methodology.

> Lean is not about money. It's about producing knowledge, quickly.

Remove any activity that does not produce knowledge.

* Ultimately, an MVE should answer:
	* Do people know how to use your product (easy)
	* Do people want to use your product (hard)

---

name: demand
class: center, middle, inverse

.jumboji[🤑]
## Make It Cost

???

But asking a customer "Would you use this?" isn't an accurate way of understanding demand.

> Until you make saying "Yes" cost something to a respondant, their repsonse doesn't mean anything.

The cost can be:
* Time
* Reputation (social media, invites, etc.)
* Money

Getting buy in with an email address isn't a good signal either - it's too low a price.

> If the customer doesn't say "Yes", that's extremely valuable.

* If you get "No", then the next question is really important: 
* "Why?".
* The customer is really good at telling you this.

.jumboji[📈&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🙋]
## Quantitative vs Qualitative

???

What sort of knowledge should you be gathering to test your hypothesis?

* Quantitative or Qualitative?
* e.g. How your product is use? Or, why your product is used?
* e.g. Analytics and numbers? Or, user feedback?

It's a false debate:

> Use many different types of information to _triangulate_ a solution.

Follow up quantitative questions (how) with qualitative (why).

.jumboji[📈&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🙋]
## Quantitative + Qualitative

???

It's a false debate:

> Use many different types of information to _triangulate_ a solution.

Follow up quantitative questions (how) with qualitative (why).

For example, looking at AB Test results might show you that Landing Page A converts 10% more than B.

It will even show you that A has longer page views, more engagement, etc.

That's quantitative data. But it doesn't tell you _why_ A performs better.

So gather qualitative data. Ask users what they liked about A, and what they thought made it better than B.

#### When we validate demand we get _a lot closer_ to hitting our product target.

name: failure
class: center, middle

# Failure
## Beware Vanity Metrics

???

> Failure is NOT A BAD THING.

In fact, if your first hypothesis didn't fail, I'd be concerned that there was a problem with my testing.

Expect to fail. Multiple times.

Celebrate when you fail. 🎉

Even when you succeed - look for points of failure.

[Choosing Metrics That Matter](https://segment.com/academy/intro/choosing-metrics-that-matter/)

---

name: highlight
class: center, middle

.jumboji[🔦]
## Metrics should highlight failure.

???

Every metric should highlight (not hide) failure.

Why is failure good?

The whole point of a hypothesis is to gain knowledge. You gain more from failure, than you do from success.

If you're not careful, your metrics will not alert you to that failure. You need to choose metrics that highlight your failure.

---

name: growth
class: center, middle

.jumboji[👶🏻👦🏻👨🏻👴🏻]
## Measure growth, not totals.

???

Using metrics like Total Downloads or Total Active Installs is a big mistake.

They will always look good. They won't highlight failure.

If I told you that my plugin has 14,000 installs, that sounds good right?

I could tell you that it has 14,000,000 installs, it sounds equally as impressive.

Totals are a waste of time. It's rates and growth that matters.

I can tell you that my plugin grows it's Active Users by 10% every month. If I notice that it falls to 5% one month, that's a clear indication of failure.

> Make it impossible to hide from failure.

Choose a time frame which provides stable data.

---

name: owner
class: center, middle

.jumboji[👑]
## Metrics need a clear owner.

???

One department's failure shouldn't be able to hide in another's success.

What if we were measuring Monthly Recurring Revenue. Sounds like a metric for the Sales team, right?

But… what about the self-serve web-based signup tool? Doesn't that belong to the Product team?

If one team does particularly well one month, and the other team doesn't, our metric balances out and hides the failure.

Or we could measure something like Server Cost per Month. That seems like a good metric, right? That would belong to the Engineering department.

Not so fast, though. If our Sales and Marketing teams increased pageviews by 200% one month, our server cost would go up, at no fault of Engineering.

So it's impossible to say just how efficient our infrastructure is with that metric.

Instead, use something like Cost per 1 Million API Calls. It's a ratio, not a total.

#### When we embrace failure and reject vanity metrics, we get _a clear look_ at our product target.
