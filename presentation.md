# What is
# WordPress as a Service?

???

* Broadly, when your product is centrally hosted, and people pay to use your website / service

* Examples:
	* ManageWP
	* InfinteWP
	* iThemes Sync
	* Happy Tables
	* Restaurant Engine
	* Hello Bar
	* PressBooks
	* Rainmaker Platform
	* WordPress.com
	
> Still a lot of untapped potential.

* More than just a blogging platform
	* Blogging
	* CMS
	* Apps

* Lots of built-in foundational groundwork for SaaS
	* User Management
	* Custom Post Types / Taxonomies

* Lots of tools and plugins to make it even easier
	* Subscription
	* WooCommerce / EDD
	* Restrict Content Pro
	
But this presentation isn't about the technical details.

There are already presentations on WordPress.tv about _why_ WP is a good SaaS Platform.

Let's talk instead about how to make your WPaaS product successful.

# Experimentation
## Hypothesis Driven Development

???

> Hypothesis Driven Development

* What does this mean?
* It's the right way to develop a product idea

Here's how it works:

1. You have an idea
2. You come up with a hypothesis
	* A hypothesis doesn't start with "I believe..." (otherwise it's true by default)
	* More clear: "If this, then that"
	* A good start: "If I show people a screenshot, they will download"
	* Be even clearer
	* "If I show people who work for a WordPress Agency a screenshot demonstrating how my product will save them time, they will download it"
3. You test the hypothesis
4. You apply the results to your product

What sort of knowledge should you be gathering to test your hypothesis?

* Quantitative or Qualitative?
* e.g. How your product is use? Or, why your product is used?
* e.g. Analytics and numbers? Or, user feedback?

It's a false debate:

> Use many different types of information to _triangulate_ a solution.

Follow up quantitative questions (how) with qualitative (why).

# Validation
## Minimum Viable Experiment

???

Let's talk about MVP: Minimum Viable Product

* MVP? I prefer MVE - Minimum Viable Experiment
* Different people have different ideas about what a product is
* By calling it an experiment, it takes away a lot of stakeholder attachment
* The idea of an MVE is to test a hypothesis

The Lean methodology is not about money

> It's about producing knowledge, quickly.

Remove any activity that does not produce knowledge.

* Ultimately, an MVE should answer:
	* Do people know how to use your product (easy)
	* Do people want to use your product (hard)
	
But asking a customer "Would you use this?" isn't an accurate way of understanding demand.

> Until you make saying "Yes" cost something to a respondant, their repsonse doesn't mean anything.

The cost can be:
* Time
* Reputation (social media, invites, etc.)
* Money

Getting buy in with an email address isn't a good signal either - it's too low a price.

> If the customer doesn't say "Yes", that's extremely valuable.

* If you get "No", then the next question is really important: 
* "Why?".
* The customer is really good at telling you this.

Don't build your product on opinions or estimates or guesstimates. Validate your hypothesis, and make a decision based on that.
